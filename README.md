## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is available from various sources. For this project, it can be downloaded using popular libraries like TensorFlow or directly from the official website.


## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-ANN.git
